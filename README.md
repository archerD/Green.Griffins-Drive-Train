﻿# One Day Robot Code
This repository is a fork of the [ftc-app](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app) at commit 83d998b, Febuary 9, 2016.
It contains an abstract opmode for the hardware of the Green.Griffins; one day robot, and several opmodes for controlling the robot.
They rely on having the motors named "left_motor" and "right_motor" and an optical distance sensor called "distance_sensor" in the hardware map.

# ftc_app
FTC Android Studio project to create FTC Robot Controller app.

This is the FTC SDK that can be used to create an FTC Robot Controller app, with custom op modes.
The FTC Robot Controller app is designed to work in conjunction with the FTC Driver Station app.
The FTC Driver Station app is available through Google Play.

To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.
Use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").

Documentation for the FTC SDK are included with this repository.  There is a subfolder called "doc" which contains several subfolders:

 * The folder "apk" contains the .apk files for the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.
 * The folder "javadoc" contains the JavaDoc user documentation for the FTC SDK.
 * The folder "tutorial" contains PDF files that help teach the basics of using the FTC SDK.

For technical questions regarding the SDK, please visit the FTC Technology forum:

**************************************************************************************

Release 16.02.09

 * Improved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface.
 * Improved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and “self-healing” to USB disconnects:
    - If user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up.
    - When running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC & DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s).
    - If a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module.
    - Warning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module that’s missing plus its USB serial number).   
 * Code changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode.
 * NXT light sensor output is now properly scaled.  Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes.
 * On DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver.
 * Robot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps.
 * Incorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that don’t use the “<TEAM NUMBER>-“ format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices.
 * Updated text in License file.
 * Fixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString().
 * Fixed issue on with a blank (“”) device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing.
 * Made a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC.
 * Improved javadoc generation.
 * Modified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future.

**************************************************************************************

**************************************************************************************

Release 15.11.04.001

 * Added Support for Modern Robotics Gyro.
  - The GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor.

  - Example MRGyroTest.java op mode included.
 * Improved error messages
  - More descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code.
 * Updated DcMotor API

**************************************************************************************

In this latest version of the FTC SDK (20150803_001) the following changes should be noted:

 * New user interfaces for FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.
 * An init() method is added to the OpMode class.
   - For this release, init() is triggered right before the start() method.
   - Eventually, the init() method will be triggered when the user presses an "INIT" button on driver station.
   - The init() and loop() methods are now required (i.e., need to be overridden in the user's op mode).
   - The start() and stop() methods are optional.
 * A new LinearOpMode class is introduced.
   - Teams can use the LinearOpMode mode to create a linear (not event driven) program model.
   - Teams can use blocking statements like Thread.sleep() within a linear op mode.
 * The API for the Legacy Module and Core Device Interface Module have been updated.
   - Support for encoders with the Legacy Module is now working.
 * The hardware loop has been updated for better performance.
